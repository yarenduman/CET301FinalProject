# WeatherApp

# The goal of the project

Weather application is one of the most useful applications in our daily life.
Although there are many weather applications we use, the simplest and most understandable ones are generally preferred.
So, I worked on an application in this direction as a final project.


## UI of the application

This weather application offers users a simple and understandable interface.
The application starts with the weather forecast of Izmir. 
There is a blue solid background to increase readability. 
There is a search button at the top. 
In the middle,there are weather state icon, current temperature, weather state as text, and city's name.
At the bottom, there is a scroll view showing the 7-day weather forecast. A weekly weather forecast is available by scrolling down.
The rows in this section include date, weather state icon, current temperature, weather state as text and predictability, respectively.

Users can access instant and weekly weather forecasts of other cities by using the search button.
Users will see an error text when searching for a city name that is misspelled or not included in the data.

I pulled the data using the API method. 
The database that I used has data of three cities from Turkey; Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir. 
However, it is possible to reach cities in different parts of the world.
